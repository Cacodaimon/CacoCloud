It also lets you create new user account.\r\n\r\nIf you are planning to use the password manager component and using [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/) you should modify log format, take the example virtual host file from `config/vhost.cfg`! And don't forget to use https instead of http!\r\n\r\n\r\n## Used components\r\n\r\nCacoCloud is based on some awesome open source libraries and frameworks.\r\n\r\nThe RESTful backend is based on [Slim PHP](http://www.slimframework.com/), rss/atom feeds gets parsed by [SimplePie](http://simplepie.org/) and E-Mail are send through SMTP by [PHPMailer](http://simplepie.org/).\r\n\r\nSince CacoCloud is an SPA, the frontend is build with love, [AngularJs](http://angularjs.org/) and [AngularUI Router](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router). Password stored into the password manager gets encrypted by [crypto-js](https://code.google.com/p/crypto-js/) on the client (no fear they are encrypted a second time by [Mcrypt](http://php.net/mcrypt) before they are stored into the database on the server). [zxcvbn](https://github.com/lowe/zxcvbn) estimates the strength of you password before storing it into the password manager.\r\n\r\nThanks to [Bootstrap 3.0](http://getbootstrap.com/) the frontend is clean and responsible and a nice theme from [Bootswatch](http://bootswatch.com/) lets it not looks so Bootstrapped. The icons are by [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/).\r\n\r\nAt last all frontend code gets minified with the use of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). \r\n\r\n[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/Cacodaimon/CacoCloud.png?label=ready)](http://waffle.io/Cacodaimon/CacoCloud)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
